# MIE250
Independent coursework from the Industrial Engineering course MIE250 to learn Java

# Note
The user interfaces for my solutions may differ from those provided by students enrolled in the course. This is because they had access to a compiled version of the completed project, and were expected to experiment with it to learn all the messages it could create. In the absence of this, I exercised my creativity. :)
